## Project Description
This project aims to develop a real-time face emotion recognition system using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system captures live video from a camera feed, detects faces within each frame, and accurately predicts the emotional state of the individuals in real-time. Emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutrality, sadness, and surprise are classified. The project involves preprocessing video frames, implementing a Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) neural network for emotion prediction, and overlaying the predicted emotion on the video feed. This practical application can find use in various domains, including human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and user experience enhancement. It represents an intermediate-level project that demonstrates proficiency in computer vision, deep learning, and real-time applications.
